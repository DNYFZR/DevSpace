# pyDevLib - Python developer tools library

I'm building this as a side project, where it goes from here is all part of the fun...

The initial plan is to include :

DevOps :

    - Automated integration testing with GitHub actions.

    - Automated package building under suitable conditions.

DevTools :

    - A parallel processing class, built with the Python multiprocessing library.

    - Data ingestion & processing tools in a fucntions library.
